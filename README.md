# genDA-code
Supplementary code for my genDA thesis chapter - simulations

I didn't create a proper "plotting" file - I just had a template and would change the filtering etc to create the graphic I need based on the simulation data loaded into the environment.

I will create that file now - to come in the coming days (as of 5/11).

For now, code to run the simulations is up, for both GLLVM estimation, genDA prediction, and Appendix - boral simulation code.
