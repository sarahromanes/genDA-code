# genDA-code
Supplementary code for my genDA thesis chapter - simulations

Code to run simulations as well as generate plots. For each of the folders, the simulation codes need to be run first, and an `.RData` file saved, in order to run the simulations.

The package `genDA` is needed, can be installed from my github `devtools::install_github("sarahromanes/genDA")`. 

Please track an issue if something doesn't work.

Like the multiDA simulations, this requires parallel computing. Can take many weeks to run the GLLVM simulations, as well as the boral simulations.
